# Magic Square Visualizer
This app visualizes the algorithm which calculates Magic Squares with odd number of sides. A Magic Square is a 'n x n' grid where all the rows, columns, and diagonals add up to the same "magic number". 

DISCLAIMER: The live demo is currently not working due to some compatibility issues with Binder and the qt5 framework. Please check out the jupyter notebook above for code.
